**Note that you need a card with a size of 400MB or more**

# Installation #

## Linux ##

Uncompress image:

` unxz torberry.img.xz`

Write image to SD card:

` dd bs=1M if=torberry.img of=/dev/mmcblk0`

## Windows ##

Image can be uncompressed with [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/). You will also need [Win32DiskImager](https://launchpad.net/win32-image-writer), just use the uncompressed image with it. It has to be done as administrator.

Once you are done, you can boot torberry.
